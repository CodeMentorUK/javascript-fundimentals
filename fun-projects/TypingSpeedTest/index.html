        <h1>Welcome to the Typing Speed Test!</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a young programmer named John. John loved coding and was always looking for ways to improve his skills. One day, he stumbled upon a typing speed test website and decided to give it a try.</p>
        <p>The test challenged him to type a 200-word story as quickly and accurately as possible. Excited by the challenge, John positioned his fingers on the keyboard and began typing.</p>
