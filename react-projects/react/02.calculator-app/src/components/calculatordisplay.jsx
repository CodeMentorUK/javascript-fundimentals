/* 
   Advice for implementing CalculatorDisplay:
   1. Component Purpose: The primary purpose of this component is to display the current value in the calculator, which can be either user input or the result of a calculation.

   2. Prop Usage: The component receives a single prop 'value', which is used to display the content of the calculator display. It's a common pattern in React to pass data as props to child components.

   3. Styling: The component applies styling using CSS classes ('bg-gray-100', 'text-slate-900', etc.) to achieve a visually appealing and readable calculator display. It's important to maintain consistency with the overall UI design.

   4. Dynamic Content: By using curly braces '{value}', the component dynamically renders the value received via the 'value' prop. This allows the display to update whenever the 'value' prop changes.

   5. Responsiveness: Ensure that the display adapts to different screen sizes, as it's an important aspect of creating a responsive user interface.

   6. Keep It Simple: This component's responsibility is limited to rendering the value, keeping it simple and focused. Separation of concerns is a best practice in React development.
